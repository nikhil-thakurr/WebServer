In Java there is Garbage collector so anything we  declare in heap , we dont have to take care to remove it but in c++ there is no GC so we can use smart pointers

static method resides in memory so it doesnot matter if u make its object or not 

// Main method is public because JVM calls it , and it should be static as well as we do not want to create an object then calls it but it should be in memory whenever we need it .

Java is Platform independent 
Java is highy portable - WORA (write once , run anywhere)
Java has 3 components - JVM < JRE < JDK

JVM ( Java Virtual Machine ) It is Platform dependedent ,it will be different for mac os & windows 
Java Program - compiler - ByteCode -  passed through JVM - Machine Code  -  CPU - Output
JVM = .class

Any code can be run by JVM irrespective where it was coded e.g mobile

JRE (Java RunTime Environment)
JRE = JVM + class libraries
If you have JRE , You can run any Java Program


JDK ( Java Development kit)
JDK = JRE + (Prog Language + Debugger + Compiler + some other things)

JSE = Java Standar Edition ( CORE JAVA )
JEE = Java Enterprise edition  = JSE + Some Standard APIS Like transactional (commit,rollback) servlets,JSP
JME = Java micro/mobile edition = Apis for mobile 


Q - Why only one public class in JAVA class ? 
 1 . As JVM calls main ,it should be public
 2 . Class Name is Same as File Name
